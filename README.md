# EU COST Action CA17106 on _Mobilising Data, Experts and Policies in Scientific Collections_

Slides used during the working group 2 meeting in Coimbra (2021) regarding _Development of Standards and Guidelines for Data gathering and large-scale digitisation_.

My presentation was on different uses of ML (mostly audio) and also a bit of SE, with examples regarding concepts and prototypes.
